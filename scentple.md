    <h3>Fragrance Sampling Kiosk</h3>
		<p>
			Our fragrance kiosk guides shoppers through an interactive selection guide to help them choose the fragrance that's right for them.
		</p>
    <p>
      When a shopper finds this fragrance, the kiosk dispenses a card with:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Brand information</li>
      <li>Product name</li>
      <li>Product logo</li>
      <li>A QR code for future engagements</li>
      <li>The fragrance</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The fragrance dispenses on the card at the time of selection, for the most accurate fragrance representation.

			Help engage customers in non-traditional markets, such as big box stores and pharmacies.
